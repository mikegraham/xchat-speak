- tested with xchat version 2.8.8

INSTALLATION

- copy xchat-speak.py to ~/.xchat2

if festival is working, when xchat starts, it should say "speech activated".
it should speek all PRIVMSGs on all channels out loud.
if two folks post at the same time, both are spoken concurrently.

COMMANDS IN XCHAT

/mute [speaker] Stop speaking everything in a channel or private message, or mute a specific speaker in all channels.
/unmute [speaker] Start speaking everything in a channel or private message, or unmute a specific speaker in all channels.

BUGS
- had lots of aplay processes build up at start once, one for each message
